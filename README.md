# AI Labeling & Annotation Portfolio

This repository showcases my hands-on experience in **AI data labeling and annotation** for **computer vision, NLP, and video-based AI systems**.  
It contains well-structured sample datasets annotated using industry-standard tools and formats.

The goal of this repository is to demonstrate **annotation quality, consistency, and readiness for real-world machine learning pipelines**.

## 📌 Annotation Types Covered

### 🖼 Image Annotation
- Bounding box annotation
- Polygon / segmentation masks
- Object classification
- Multi-class labeling

**Supported formats**
- YOLO (v5 / v8)
- COCO JSON
- Pascal VOC (XML)

---

### 🎥 Video Annotation
- Frame-by-frame object tracking
- Temporal bounding boxes
- Action / event tagging
- Keyframe labeling

---

### 📝 Text Annotation (NLP)
- Text classification
- Entity labeling (NER)
- Sentiment annotation
- Instruction-following datasets

---

## 🛠 Tools & Platforms Used
- Label Studio
- CVAT
- Manual QA review process
- Python (for validation & structure checks)

---

---

## ✅ Annotation Quality Standards
- Tight and accurate bounding boxes
- Consistent class naming
- Normalized coordinates (YOLO)
- Clear segmentation boundaries
- Manual review before final export
- No missing or duplicated labels

All samples are created using **self-sourced or open datasets**.  
No confidential or client-owned data is included.

---

## 🎯 Use Cases
- Computer vision model training
- Object detection & segmentation
- Autonomous systems
- AI research & academic projects
- Dataset validation & QA
